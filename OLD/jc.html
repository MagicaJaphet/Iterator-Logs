                        <p>There's been rumors that there is another in our group, but no one can establish contact with them. A very strange decision on our creators to leave them outside of our range of broadcasts. Or who knows, our equipment's starting to kick the bucket finally.</p>
                        <p>I know mine has been acting up as of late, much sooner than even Scope's! I'm not that much younger than everyone, but still... A rough activation leads us to this point, I suppose.</p>
                        <p>I've managed to theorize about a long-term storage unit lately that involves engraining it in the natural evolution of a purposed organism, if you sequence the DNA juuust right... It may be possible to carry a long-term message or concept within the organism's lineage. Something simple, of course. It can't be something complex like a poem or stationary image.</p>
                        <p>The others and those outside our group keep talking of this Great Problem we're all meant to solve. I haven't had much of the heart to tell them I've only heard bits and pieces what it's about. For some reason, it's forbidden to talk about it directly? Some iterator named Sliver or something. Well, if I wasn't built for that purpose then I will not focus on digging further into it. But, it's nice to keep a record of my thoughts on it amongst all these pictures my overseers take.</p>
                        <p>I think what I want to try, if my theory is plausible... I will create a walking memorial that goes out to my creators. They wanted to abate their bodies so terribly of themselves, but I hardly see it the same. I should be thankfully I am alive at all at this rate.</p>
                        <p>I will consider this my tribute.</p>

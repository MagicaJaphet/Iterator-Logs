                        <p>There's been rumors that there is another in our group, but no one can establish contact with them. A very strange decision on our creators to leave them outside of our range of broadcasts. Or who knows, our equipment's starting to kick the bucket finally.</p>
                        <p>I know mine has been acting up as of late, much sooner than even Scope's! I'm not that much younger than everyone, but still... A rough activation leads us to this point, I suppose.</p>
                        <p>I've managed to theorize about a long-term storage unit lately that involves engraining it in the natural evolution of a purposed organism, if you sequence the DNA juuust right... It may be possible to carry a long-term message or concept within the organism's lineage. Something simple, of course. It can't be something complex like a poem or stationary image.</p>
                        <p>The others and those outside our group keep talking of this Great Problem we're all meant to solve. I haven't had much of the heart to tell them I've only heard bits and pieces what it's about. For some reason, it's forbidden to talk about it directly? Some iterator named Sliver or something. Well, if I wasn't built for that purpose then I will not focus on digging further into it. But, it's nice to keep a record of my thoughts on it amongst all these pictures my overseers take.</p>
                        <p>I think what I want to try, if my theory is plausible... I will create a walking memorial that goes out to my creators. They wanted to abate their bodies so terribly of themselves, but I hardly see it the same. I should be thankfully I am alive at all at this rate.</p>
                        <p>I will consider this my tribute.</p>

                        <p>Update Status: I have exhausted all reasonable means in attempt to fix my communications. It appears... nothing will suffice, my model number is out of date for any of the proposed repairs I kept backlogged in the event of this happening. Why I didn't think of that ahead of time, I'm unsure, but now it costs me THIS.</p>
                        <p>... I hope the others are still holding out for me, I WILL find a way to reboot my communications somehow.</p>
                        <p>The irony of DPS's last statement is prying at my brain. Oh, the fleeting beauty of life indeed. INDEED! ... I never imagined it would be gone this fast. Their citizens haven't yet fulled passed on, still. They'll know how much it hurts eventually... and I won't even be there to comfort them.</p>
                        <p>... My only regret is not preparing a farewell message beforehand, maybe the illusion of it all made me forget to consider such an inevitability. Why was I so absent-minded for all of those cycles? Did they forget to program me with a stable ability to focus? I'd barely consider my flaws before, but now... now they're stuck right in front of me, preventing me from reaching them.</p>
                        <p>Surely, given my status as a prototype... I must find a backdoor to my processies. I can abuse this.</p>

These organisms should theoretically be able to be programmed remotely by me, by abusing a loophole in the very early version of the taboos I contain.</p>
                        <p>USING THESE ORGANISMS, and my archives of how exactly to FIX an iterator, I SHOULD be able to direct them to FIX MY COMMUNICATION ARRAYS DIRECTLY! Very clever of me, I know. I know. The only PROBLEM as of current, is their unstable behavior. SURE, I am able to control them remotely, BUT IT SEEMS... They do not EXACTLY have a stable physical vessel, which is frankly QUITE AN ANNOYANCE.</p>

If my messenger is emitting any weird sounds, that is why. They may repeat things that they heard out in the wild as well.

                        <p>... I hope the others are still holding out for me, I WILL find a way to reboot my communications somehow.</p>
                        <p>The irony of DPS's last statement is prying at my brain. Oh, the fleeting beauty of life indeed. INDEED! ... I never imagined it would be gone this fast. Their citizens haven't yet fulled passed on, still. They'll know how much it hurts eventually... and I won't even be there to comfort them.</p>
                        <p>... My only regret is not preparing a farewell message beforehand, maybe the illusion of it all made me forget to consider such an inevitability. Why was I so absent-minded for all of those cycles? Did they forget to program me with a stable ability to focus? I'd barely consider my flaws before, but now... now they're stuck right in front of me, preventing me from reaching them.</p>
                        <p>Surely, given my status as a prototype... I must find a backdoor to my processies. I can abuse this.</p>

These organisms should theoretically be able to be programmed remotely by me, by abusing a loophole in the very early version of the taboos I contain.</p>
                        <p>USING THESE ORGANISMS, and my archives of how exactly to FIX an iterator, I SHOULD be able to direct them to FIX MY COMMUNICATION ARRAYS DIRECTLY! Very clever of me, I know. I know. The only PROBLEM as of current, is their unstable behavior. SURE, I am able to control them remotely, BUT IT SEEMS... They do not EXACTLY have a stable physical vessel, which is frankly QUITE AN ANNOYANCE.</p>
                        <p>They have a TENDANCY TO YELL AND MAKE NOISES, along with SOME succumbing to very INSTANT instances of mental collapse. I haven't YET found a way to get around THAT PROBLEM, but as long as they c can last long enough to FIX MY ISSUE, it should be all fine, right?</p>

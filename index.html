                <p>Hello! welcome to my iterator logs, this is where I collect my fanfics related to my iterator OCs! I also kind of flex my CSS and HTML knowledge here, and yes this is all done without Javascript (Although I do know a bit of that)!</p>
                <p>Currently, I have a collection of logs for:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><a href="#bcf">> Buzzing Community Feeds</a> [Facebook group-like iterators]</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>I do also have various Rainworld AUs, which I may eventually link here too! For now, feel free to send me feedback about this site wherever I'm linking it. I wish to make this site as user friendly as possible (Especially people who need to work with screen readers)!</p>

            <div class="groupblurb">
                <p>A group of iterators based on the idea of karma 3. More specifically, they are inspired by the infantilization of animals and prioritizing the communication lines for as long as possible. Even when their equipment errodes or disconnects, they find ways.</p>
                <p>They also explore the ideas of iterators ignoring their greater purposes, ironically finding out what the cycle is really about. There are a few notable organisms which play a role in their story.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>> The Pastiche: A purposed pipecleaner who intentionally looks like a lizard, with the ability to shift color.</li>
                    <li>> The Domesticated: A wild descendant of a pipecleaner who made friends with a group of scavengers.</li>
                    <li>> The Mime: A purposed pipecleaner trained to mimic the sounds and motions of iterators and organisms to convey a message.</li>
                    <li>> The Product: A purposed creature, made with the intention of mimicking the ancients in sentience.</li>

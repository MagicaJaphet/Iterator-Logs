(GF) Ah, hello Listing Marathons of Seven Living Blocks! What brings you in my chamber in this early phase of the cycle?
(LMSB) It is very nice to see you, Firefly.
(LMSB) I come on very Urgent business on this day.
(GF) ...? What would that entail, may I inquire?
(LMSB) A neighboring City has endulged Us on the details of a possible, very Important project they ask us to Aid them in.
(GF) [Seems to be preoccupied by an unfinished task, several qualia are still in the midst of deep processing] What sort of project?
(GF) Another landmark in which to occupy? A need to expand farm land, perhaps? Is it something you require my help with?
(LMSB) Oh, no No. This is a Far more important matter.
[Listing Marathons takes caution to approach Grinding Fireflies, pulling them away from their work rather abruptly]
(LMSB) They are highly considering being the Willing subjects to participate in a Grand, Brand new architecture. Another one of your kind, Just...
(LMSB) [They seem to pause for reasons unknown] More Rounded out! It will be a great Deal, and it would possibly mean we will try to establish the First of it's kind.
>(LMSB) An interwoven connection between All existing functioning models of Iterators.
(GF) ... What does that mean for me?
(LMSB) [Noted to seem panicked in reaction] Nothing bad, no No! I hope you can Comprehend the emotional weight of this decision.
(LMSB) You, as an Iterator yourself, will No longer be alone.
(LMSB) It is a topic I will admit a lot of Us speak on, the Responsibility to keep your soul in High regard. We as organisms know the crushing weight of Loneliness.
(LMSB) And it is irresponsible to keep you alone.

While it's in my best interest to Express this feeling with my current Administrator, I feel Reserved at this moment...
I've contemplated what All this means for my future. I hadn't even thought of the possibility, but now it's glaring me in the face. Senority? Is that not a privilege for I? I have existed longer than All of our citizens.
They have been discussing and mulling over this for entire Lifetimes, and they kept this information from me? Listing Marathons would consider my feelings.
I suppose there is Solace in that I will no longer be alone, but... I can't push the feeling that it is as if They thought they could satiate my lack of Company with a playmate.
I don't consider this action of betrayal to be keeping Them in high regards. What can be done about it, though?

(GF) It seemed counterproductive to, given you likely already Know everything I do, and possibly more given the recent Iterator Revelations.
(DPS) ... Well it is true, our numbers are starting to grow rapidly. There is already Much interest!
(DPS) I would not know if I contain your entire memory bank without manually searching through it myself, which is not a feature I was equipped with, even as your Senior.

There's been rumors that there is another in our group, but no one can establish contact with them. A very strange decision on our creators to leave them outside of our range of broadcasts. Or who knows, our equipment's starting to kick the bucket finally.
I know mine has been acting up as of late, much sooner than even Scope's! I'm not that much younger than everyone, but still... A rough activation leads us to this point, I suppose.
I've managed to theorize about a long-term storage unit lately that involves engraining it in the natural evolution of a purposed organism, if you sequence the DNA juuust right... It may be possible to carry a long-term message or concept within the organism's lineage. Something simple, of course. It can't be something complex like a poem or stationary image.
The others and those outside our group keep talking of this Great Problem we're all meant to solve. I haven't had much of the heart to tell them I've only heard bits and pieces what it's about. For some reason, it's forbidden to talk about it directly? Some iterator named Sliver or something. Well, if I wasn't built for that purpose then I will not focus on digging further into it. But, it's nice to keep a record of my thoughts on it amongst all these pictures my overseers take.
I think what I want to try, if my theory is plausible... I will create a walking memorial that goes out to my creators. They wanted to abate their bodies so terribly of themselves, but I hardly see it the same. I should be thankfully I am alive at all at this rate.

Did they forget to program me with a stable ability to focus? I'd barely consider my flaws before, but now... now they're stuck right in front of me, preventing me from reaching them.

USING THESE ORGANISMS, and my archives of how exactly to FIX an iterator, I SHOULD be able to direct them to FIX MY COMMUNICATION ARRAYS DIRECTLY! Very clever of me, I know. I know. The only PROBLEM as of current, is their unstable behavior. SURE, I am able to control them remotely, BUT IT SEEMS... They do not EXACTLY have a stable physical vessel, which is frankly QUITE AN ANNOYANCE.
They have a TENDENCY TO YELL AND MAKE NOISES, along with SOME succumbing to very INSTANT instances of mental collapse. I haven't YET found a way to get around THAT PROBLEM, but as long as they c can last long enough to FIX MY ISSUE, it should be all fine, right?

>(GF) I APOLOGIZE! i apoLOGIZE FOR BRINGING YOU INTO THIS P P PAINFUL EXISTENCE! PLEASE ST-
[Grinding Fireflies is cut off by a sudden bang sound, the sound of a metal arm connecting to his face.]

??: This. What get. For hurt.
??: I. I am. I am alive. I not. Follow order.
>(GF) I-I'm s sorry... I'm sorry... I'm sorry I'm sorry-

(LABL) Oh? A little beast! Oh my, are you the one Pragma was hinting at?
[Chirping and the sound of movement can be heard.]
(LABL) ... What cute movements and sounds! Wow! It's almost like they're with us. Do you understand what you're saying?
(LABL) Oh! A pearl? Allow me to examine that- I'll read it aloud for you, little beast.
>(DPS) If you are receiving this message, that means that my little messenger has made it to your facility, Lights. They are part of a new experiment I'm running, where I am training some more domesticated species to mimic and transport messages physically like this. If my messenger is emitting any weird sounds, that is why. They may repeat things that they heard out in the wild as well. I am unsure how fullproof this is, but attached in this message is an image I took of the Mime, as I call them.
(LABL) Ah, this is indeed a picture that resembles you, little one. You must be the Mime!
[Trilling sounds.]
(LABL) Hehe, I am very fond of your mimicking ability. Why don't you send a message back for me to let Pragma know you've made a complete roundtrip?

[PING.]
(DPS) ... Hello, can you hear me?
[It looks at me with confusion.]
(DPS) Hiii, I apologize for refraining from giving you the mark before. I wanted to ensure your training was possible thus far, and now that I'm confident I gift you the gift of communication.
(DPS) This is one-way. If you can understand, blink twice.
...
(DPS) Good! Now, do you remember the practice rounds? It's time for your first real stress test. Don't worry, if you make it back I will be sure to reward you.
(DPS) Take this, now deliver it here, if you would. I have a path laid out for you!
>(DPS) Now that our broadcasts are finally giving up... I hope this suffices.
(DPS) If it does... Ah. Just maybe.
>(DPS) Firefly. I'm still listening.

[Scratching of claws, something making its way into the chamber]
(DPS) Ah! Oh my... Mime, you've returned?
(DPS) ... Then that means it is theoretically possible for you to traverse for long periods of time. Good job!
[A pearl can be heard dinking on the floor of the chamber.]
(DPS) ...! And Lights managed to repurpose this pearl, I see.
(DPS) Allow me to read this first, I have not forgotten about that reward I promised.
>(DPS) ...
(LABL) I got your message, Pragma! A simple but clever use of the pipecleaner blueprint, I see. Since my communications have rusted over, I have also been working on my own methods to continue our broadcasts. I advise you to send some overseers to the highest point in your facility over the next 40 cycles. If you see something in my direction that looks odd, you know it's working!
(DPS) I see... I will be sure to keep a look out.
(DPS) Here, this is your reward.
[An electric whirring can be heard, as something is brought out from a panel in the chamber.]
[Happy chittering]
(DPS) Thank you... thank you...
>[The Mime departs with their reward for now.]
(DPS) ... I hope the journey will not become a dead-end endeavor. I'm already growing fond of this one.

It seems I'VE exhausted aLL MEANS to... to fix myself... My creations, who wERE made to h help. I only birthed them i in my anger and grief... What have I done?
... The Product D dOESN't seem to be affected like THE other sen Sentient ones. A-are they Sentient? ... Do I harbor tHE heaVY implication of even BEING able to makE anything CLOSE to my creators?
MY actions are. My actions are, starting to catch up wITH ME. WHY OH WHY WHY WOULD I DO THIS??? What Would the OTHERS THINK OF ME? ... I'm so sorry...
Am I mad? ... I I am. I am mad. I have lost it. I have lost it all, I have lost myself... This is NOT what my creators envisioned. They would decomMIssion me if they kNEW wHAT I'VE BEEN DOING. I'm so sorry... but, who AM i apologizing to? They can't hear me... No one can hear me... P perhaps I should look into. Into making a siren. S something loud, something that could scream for me. The screeching of steam isn't profound enough to express this. This pain that tears a rift in my very SOUL.
I... I just. I just need SOMETHING to hear me. But, there are no gods here but me.
... I want to make life better for my child, can I do that?
